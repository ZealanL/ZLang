# ZLang

My own programming language, written from scratch in C++.

GOALS:
- Easy to write and understand - clean and nonverbose syntax
- Compiles directly to machinecode and executables/libs for Windows and Linux

IN PROGRESS:
- Core language parsing
- Compiler to ZIL (ZLang Intermediate Language)
- Compiler from ZIL to x86

ROADMAP:
- Compiler for x86_64
- Executable builder for Windows and Linux
- Transpiler to C or C++
- Standard library
